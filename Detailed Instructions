In this activity I was tasked with creating a python script that analyzes records to calculate each of the following:

* The total number of months included in the dataset.

* The net total amount of Profit/Losses over the entire period.

* The average of the changes in Profit/Losses over the entire period.

* The greatest increase in profits (date and amount) over the entire period.

* The greatest decrease in losses (date and amount) over the entire period.

Financial dataset was provided, file: budget_data.csv .
Dataset was composed of two columns, Dates and Profit/Losses.

# PyRamen

 The task was to analyze your business financial performance by cross-referencing your sales data with your internal menu data to figure out revenues and costs for the year. You also want to analyze how well your business did on a per-product basis (as you have several choices of ramen) in order to better understand which products are doing well, which are doing poorly, and, ultimately, which products may need to be removed or changed.
 
 
Dataset file was provided:  menu_data.csv, sales_data.csv
